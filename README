addRG_splitntrim_symptomatic.pl: pre-processing of BAM files for use with GATK4 haplotypeCaller
align_samples_hisat2_human.pl: map each fastq file with hisat2 with maximum intron length set to human parameters.
align_samples_hisat2_pf.pl: map each fastq file with hisat2 with maximum intron length set to Plasmodium parameters.
clinical_parameters.Rmd: Code used for statistical analyses and to generate all figures presented in the paper.
rmdup_geneal.pl: Custom script to remove PCR duplicate reads from BAM files. 
subset_bam_human.pl: Subset BAM files to contain only reads mapping to the human genome. 
subset_bam_plasmodiumreads.pl: Subset BAM files to contain only reads mapping to the P. falciparum genome. 
subset_vcf.pl: Remove P. falciparum multi-gene families from GATK-generated VCF file.

To map and process RNA-seq reads for use with featureCounts, run the following programs in this order: 
1) align_samples_hisat2_human.pl (for human) or align_samples_hisat2_pf.pl (for P. falciparum)
2) subset_bam_human.pl (for human) or subset_bam_plasmodiumreads.pl (for P. falciparum)
3) rmdup_geneal.pl

To process RNA-seq reads for use with GATK, run the following programs in this order: 
1) addRG_splitntrim_symptomatic.pl
2) RUN GATK HAPLOTYPE CALLER ACCORDING TO MANUSCRIPT
3) subset_vcf.pl
